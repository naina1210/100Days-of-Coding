A prime number is a natural number greater than  whose only positive divisors are  and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are , , , , , and .

Given a large integer, , use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

Input Format

A single line containing an integer,  (the number to be checked).

Constraints

 contains at most  digits.
Output Format

If  is a prime number, print prime; otherwise, print not prime.

Sample Input

13
Sample Output

prime
Explanation

The only positive divisors of  are  and , so we print prime.







import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;              //this program checks if the number you gave it is prime or not
import java.util.Scanner;

public class javaPrimalitytestWork {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);    
        String n = scan.nextLine();

        BigInteger number = new BigInteger(n);     //BigInteger is just a class type for "number" like "Scanner scan"
        
        if (number.isProbablePrime(1)) {
            System.out.println("prime");
                } else {
            System.out.println("not prime");
                }

        scan.close();
    }
    }
